    "Programs are often long and complex. A developer following best practices will split such a program into functions; but even if the developer doesn't, a program will still likely rely on a number of functions built into Python and any imported modules (such as NumPy). A **function-by-function** profiler such as the magic command `prun` will return timing information for all functions used in a program, both user-defined and otherwise. This timing information will also include the number of times a program was called. \n",
